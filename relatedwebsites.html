   <h2>Lego</h2>
   <p>
    Although they are our biggest competitor, we cannot deny the quality of their products. They also brought this genre of toy into
    the limelight, so we owe our success to them, which is why we feel the need to put them here.

    <h2>Cobi</h2>
    <p>Much like lego, Cobi came after us, but that doesn't mean that they aren't half as good. where Lego focuses more on imaginative 
        sets, such as starships and things from movies like Marvel or Star Wars, Cobi focuses much more on historical models. a few of them 
        include tanks, cars and planes. we feel like Cobi scratches an itch that Lego falls short on, which is why we have decided to include
        them here.
